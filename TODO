[ ] implement the rest of the already specified methods

[ ] ability to make ImageView focusable, so the virtual keyboard gets activated when it is tapped and you can receive keyevents. That enables you to create custom views.


[ ] for all supported views and layouts check if restoring the state works

[x] screen wakelock to keep the screen on
[x] Activity lifecycle events
[x] support for locking orientation: Activity.setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LOCKED);
[ ] system overlay window support
[ ] Action Bar with elements: https://developer.android.com/training/appbar/setting-up
[ ] App widgets
    [ ] only 1 depth layouts, because the IDs can't be changed
        [ ] or have 10 different layout files for each view type with 10 different ids, that allows a bit of nesting
            [ ] 5 for Layouts, 10 for textview and button, 5 for progress bar
            [ ] But the main dynamic content should be made with collections: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/collections
    [ ] support for using layouts in widgets (if parent != null, use R.id.remoteview as parent)
[ ] Notifications with custom Layout
[ ] method to get the screen resolution, to change layout if needed
[ ] on screen orientation change event
[ ] support for divider between elements in LinearLayouts an RecyclerViews
[ ] Gesture events
[ ] Multitouch

    - ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED
    - ACTION_LOCALE_CHANGED
    - ACTION_SCREEN_OFF
    - ACTION_SCREEN_ON
    - ACTION_TIMEZONE_CHANGED
[ ] setting explicit size for views
[ ] setting ImageView size in px, so it can be exactly the size of the bitmap buffer 
[ ] or query the current size of the ImageView to use a new buffer

    [ ] use the paging library to get good performance. When a new page is needed, send an event to the program.
        Then the program has to send back a list of json layouts to populate the view.
        To update existing items, the program can send a page unrequested.
